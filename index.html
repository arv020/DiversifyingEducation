		<p >According to the National Center for Education Studies, in Fall 2018 less than 25% of College and University faculty 
			were people of color. There is a visible lack of diversity in faculty at universities throughout the United States. 
			There is a need for educators that reflect all colors. 

			In order to address this problem, we need to see where it stems from, the pipeline problem. 
			The pipeline problem is the issue that a lot of students drop out at different stages in the process of becoming a professor.
			This can include dropping out during high school, undergraduate level, and graduate level.

			
			In this website, you are able to find data that supports this claim, as well as resources that 
			are available for underrepresented students. 
			
			<div style="line-height:20px;"><br></div> 
		
			Whether you are in STEM, Humanities, or Social Sciences, there are resources out there to help students go to college and 
			succeed in college.
			Our main data source was the National Science Foundation. 

			In my experience as an undergraduate, I have visibly seen a lack of diversity throughout the professors who 
			stand in the front of the lecture hall to teach a class, or in today's day host a Zoom call. This issue 
			is more visible in STEM classes at universities.
